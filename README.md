# Sorting Algorithm Visualizer

## Demo

(ADD SOMETHING HERE)

## Overview

The Sorting Algorithm Visualizer is a web application built with React and Tailwind CSS to help users understand and visualize various sorting algorithms in an interactive and engaging way. The visualizer supports the following sorting algorithms:

- Selection Sort
- Insertion Sort
- Quick Sort
- Bubble Sort
- Merge Sort
- Heap Sort

## Features

- **Interactive Visualization**: Step-by-step animation of sorting processes.
- **Custom Input**: Users can generate arrays of various sizes and values.
- **Speed Control**: Adjust the speed of the sorting animations.
- **Algorithm Comparison**: Easily switch between different algorithms to compare their efficiency.
- **Responsive Design**: Optimized for devices of all screen sizes using Tailwind CSS.

## Algorithms Implemented

- **Selection Sort**: Iteratively selects the smallest element and swaps it with the first unsorted element.
- **Insertion Sort**: Builds the sorted array one item at a time by inserting elements in their correct positions.
- **Quick Sort**: Divides the array into smaller subarrays using a pivot element and recursively sorts them.
- **Bubble Sort**: Repeatedly swaps adjacent elements that are out of order.
- **Merge Sort**: Divides the array into halves, sorts each half, and merges them back together.
- **Heap Sort**: Builds a max heap and repeatedly extracts the maximum element.

## Technology Stack

- **Frontend:**

  - React (v18+)
  - React Router DOM
  - TailwindCSS
  - Vanilla CSS
  - JavaScript/TypeScript

- **Deployment:**
  - Netlify (for deployment)

## Prerequisites

Ensure you have the following installed:

- **Node.js** (v16+ recommended)
- **npm** (or **yarn**, but npm is used in this project)

To check if Node.js and npm are installed, run the following commands in your terminal:

```bash
node -v
npm -v
```

If they're not installed, download and install Node.js from [this](https://nodejs.org/).

## Getting Started

### 1. Clone the Repository

To get started with the project, clone the repository to your local machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yamhokim/Sorting-Algorithm-Website.git
```

Then navigate to the project directory:

```bash
cd '.\Sorting Algorithm Website\sortAlgorithmVisualizer\'
```

### 2. Install Dependencies

Once inside the project directory, install all the necessary dependencies using npm:

```bash
npm install
```

### 3. Run the Development Server

To start the development server and preview the project locally, run:

```bash
npm run dev
```

This will launch the app at http://localhost:5173 by default.

### 4. 4. Open the Project in a Browser

Once the development server is running, open your browser and go to http://localhost:3000 to see the application in action.
