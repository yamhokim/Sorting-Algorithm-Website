# Sorting Algorithm Visualizer
## Deployment
Coming Soon
## Overview
The Sorting Algorithm Visualizer is a web application built with React and Tailwind CSS to help users understand and visualize various sorting algorithms in an interactive and engaging way. The visualizer supports the following sorting algorithms:

- Selection Sort
- Insertion Sort
- Quick Sort
- Bubble Sort
- Merge Sort
- Heap Sort

## Features
- **Interactive Visualization**: Step-by-step animation of sorting processes.
- **Custom Input**: Users can generate arrays of various sizes and values.
- **Speed Control**: Adjust the speed of the sorting animations.
- **Algorithm Comparison**: Easily switch between different algorithms to compare their efficiency.
- **Responsive Design**: Optimized for devices of all screen sizes using Tailwind CSS.

## Technologies Used
- **Frontend**: React
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS


## Algorithms Implemented
- **Selection Sort**: Iteratively selects the smallest element and swaps it with the first unsorted element.
- **Insertion Sort**: Builds the sorted array one item at a time by inserting elements in their correct positions.
- **Quick Sort**: Divides the array into smaller subarrays using a pivot element and recursively sorts them.
- **Bubble Sort**: Repeatedly swaps adjacent elements that are out of order.
- **Merge Sort**: Divides the array into halves, sorts each half, and merges them back together.
- **Heap Sort**: Builds a max heap and repeatedly extracts the maximum element.
